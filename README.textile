classes directly in your Ruby applications.

Sample:

<pre><code>
  require 'rubygems'
  require 'dnsimple'
  
  DNSimple::Client.username = 'YOUR_USERNAME'
  DNSimple::Client.password = 'YOUR_PASSWORD'

  puts "Domains..."
  Domain.all.each do |domain|
    puts "  #{domain.name}"
  end

  domain = Domain.find("example.com")
  domain.apply("template") # applies a standard or custom template to the domain

  domain = Domain.create("newdomain.com")
  puts "Added #{domain.name}"
  domain.delete # removes from DNSimple
</pre></code>
