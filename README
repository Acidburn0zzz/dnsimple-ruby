A Ruby wrapper for the DNSimple API.

== Credentials

Create a file in your home directory called .dnsimple

In this file add the following:

username: YOUR_USERNAME
password: YOUR_PASSWORD

== Commands

There are two ways to interact with the DNSimple Ruby wrapper. The first is
to use the command line utility that is included. The commands available 
are as follows:

For help:

* dnsimple help

The following commands are available for domains:

* dnsimple list
* dnsimple describe domain.com
* dnsimple create domain.com
* dnsimple delete domain.com
* dnsimple apply domain.com template_short_name

The following commands are available for records:

* dnsimple record:create [--prio=priority] domain.com name type content [ttl]
* dnsimple record:list domain.com
* dnsimple record:delete domain.com record_id

== Wrapper Classes

In addition to the command line utility you may also use the included Ruby
classes directly in your Ruby applications.

Sample:

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'dnsimple'
  
  DNSimple::Client.username = 'YOUR_USERNAME'
  DNSimple::Client.password = 'YOUR_PASSWORD'

  puts "Domains..."
  Domain.all.each do |domain|
    puts "  #{domain.name}"
  end

  domain = Domain.find("example.com")
  domain.apply("template") # applies a standard or custom template to the domain

  domain = Domain.create("newdomain.com")
  puts "Added #{domain.name}"
  domain.delete # removes from DNSimple
